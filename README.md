#Research Summary


One of the first websites is [Climate Data](https://en.climate-data.org/). Like my future site, this site aims to provide users access to climate data to help the general public plan future events by providing them with climate data to help get them an estimate of what kind of weather they entail. Functions of Climate Data's application include an interactive map that allows you to click on which continents and then takes you to a page with a list of countries and cities in that continent. When you click on the city's name, it brings you to another page. In the URL, a hashtag is used to identify a specific section in a webpage. This page provides information about the climate of each city. One feature that stood out to me was the table that they provided. They used a <tbody> to create a table with different climate scenarios depending on the month. They also add images to show the user what the cities look like and have to offer. This was a nice feature to add to my application. Another feature that stood out to me while inspecting was the usage of Bootstrap. I also noticed the use of headers and colors.

The next application similar to mine is [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services). This site used a search bar to look up locations using “class=”form-control.” I think I will add a feature like this because finding locations would make it easier for the users to navigate the applications. Another feature would be how the buttons included images to describe what they do. This feature will help users understand what function the button does. Other features I noticed from this application would be bootstrap, borders, and colors.


The third website is another website that gives out free climate data to users, [Climate](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/all?query=*&us=1). They focus on the United States. Their home page has a map of the United States divided into sections. When clicking on a section, it brings you to another page. When you click on the page, it contains a question mark in the URL. The question mark tells the website what specific information the user is trying to get. One feature that stands out is the container feature that contains specific filters to get the data. This is done by <div class=” container”> the blocks are coded within. Other features would be the use of Bootstrap, lists, and buttons.

The find-weather-app is a git hub repository that is created to a website to show the weather forecast. In the readme of this repositiory it gives you a live preview of the application. This was helpful to see, knowing I can take inspiration to what I would like my application to resemble.The readme then goes on to provided features the site contains. It allows you to use your current location and search the weather by entering a city name. From this repositiory readme I can take away that it can be used in my project by providing useful code snippets and some strucal ideas. For example I am adding a geo location to my site as well. So this repostitory gives me a good example to follow.  


This git hub repository provides a application that uses a search bar for users to look up a city and get information regarding the current and future weather. While looking through the readme they give an description of what the weather dashboard was created for. Its purpose was to provide travelers with the information about the weather they needed to know. The readme provides a live link to the application to look at. It also provides a visualixation of the application. In my project I want to create an application where users can look up there specific city. This repositiory is good to give me strucual ideas that I want to add to my own application as well as some code that could be useful.
